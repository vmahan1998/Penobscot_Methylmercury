	annote = {Based on the information from the paper, the habitat preferences for the spawning of rainbow smelt include shallow water areas with depths ranging from 1 to 5 meters, with gravel or cobble substrate, and moderate water flow. They also prefer areas with submerged aquatic vegetation, such as eelgrass, as these provide cover and refuge for eggs and larvae. In addition, the presence of other fish species, such as alewife, may also influence the choice of spawning habitats for rainbow smelt.
According to the paper, rainbow smelt were found to spawn in areas of low to moderate current velocities, with a preferred range of 0.1-0.4 m/s. Higher current velocities were found to be less suitable for spawning.
},
	annote = {Rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) is a small, anadromous fish species that typically spawn in freshwater streams and rivers, but spend the majority of their life in saltwater environments. Rainbow smelt are an important prey species for many larger predatory fish species, such as salmon and trout, and are an important food source for humans as well.
During the spawning period, which typically occurs from February to April in coastal areas of North America, rainbow smelt move into freshwater streams and rivers to lay their eggs. After spawning, the adult fish typically return to saltwater environments to feed and grow.
In an embayment, such as a bay or estuary, rainbow smelt may exhibit a range of movements and habitat use patterns during and following the spawning period. For example, adult fish may remain in freshwater environments for a period of time after spawning to recover before returning to saltwater environments. Juvenile fish may also remain in freshwater environments for a period of time before moving to saltwater environments to feed and grow.
Habitat use by rainbow smelt in an embayment can also vary based on factors such as water temperature, salinity, and prey availability. In general, rainbow smelt tend to prefer cooler water temperatures and higher salinity levels, and are often found in areas with high levels of zooplankton and other small prey.
Overall, the movements and habitat use patterns of rainbow smelt within an embayment during and following the spawning period are influenced by a variety of factors, including the timing of spawning, water temperature and salinity, and the availability of prey resources. Understanding these patterns can be important for managing and conserving rainbow smelt populations, as well as for predicting their impacts on other species in the ecosystem.

	abstract = {We examined larval dispersal and behaviour in rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) from the Salmonier River estuary, Newfoundland, during 2003–2005. Riverine ichthyoplankton surveys indicate that larval transport into the estuary is restricted to a two-week period in late June. A passive drifter experiment and the spatial distribution of larvae and juveniles suggest limited dispersal and low export from the estuary. The estuary exhibited low inflow and stratification in summer and high inflow with a stable freshwater layer in fall. Summer and fall winds are primarily onshore. We hypothesised that larval vertical swimming behaviour limits dispersal and export. Larval vertical position and swimming ability were examined through lab-based experiments conducted 0–10 and 90 days after hatching. Measurements of swim speed indicate an order of magnitude (p {\textless} 0.001) improvement in swimming capacity between larvae and juveniles. One-week after hatching, larvae displayed consistent negative geotaxis, whereas juveniles were generally deeper and displayed negative geotaxis in light and positive geotaxis in the dark. The contrasting light-mediated geotactic behavior between development stages corresponds to ontogenetic shifts in swimming abilities and seasonal changes in estuarine circulation. We suggest that the interaction between behaviour, ontogeny, and hydrography results in limited transport and a tendency for estuarine-scale recruitment, despite an extensive pelagic period.},

	abstract = {Anadromous Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) exhibit a complex life history that requires the use of habitats that span several different temporal and spatial scales. While fisheries scientists have investigated the various elements of habitat and how they affect Atlantic salmon growth and survival, these studies typically focus on requisite requirements for a single life history stage. Current advances in our understanding of salmonid populations in lotic systems indicates that ignoring the spatial positioning of different habitats and dispersal capabilities of fish between them may affect estimates of habitat quality and production of juvenile Atlantic salmon. Using the concepts of juxtaposition and interspersion, we hypothesize that discrete functional habitat units (FHU) occur within river systems and that the spatial structure of FHU affects fish production. We present a method to delineate FHU using habitat maps, fish ecology, and spatial habitat characteristics. Utilizing a simulation model, we illustrate how modeling FHU structure of spawning and rearing habitat in a river system can improve our understanding of juvenile Atlantic salmon production dynamics. The FHU concept allows a flexible approach to more comprehensive analyses of the impacts of habitat alterations, seasonal habitat shifts, and spatial ecology of salmonids at various scales.},

Both Mysis and adult alewife concentrated on the bottom during day and migrated upwards to the base of the thermocline at night. Extent and timing of vertical migrations of Mysis and alewife coincided. During bright moonlight Mysis concentrated at depths well below the thermocline and larger adult alewives concentrated within this Mysis layer while smaller adult alewives migrated to the base of the thermocline. An examination of stomach contents indicated that vertical migrations were mechanistically linked to feeding behavior. Adult alewives fed extensively on Mysis at night. Total lengths of Mysis in alewife stomachs were significantly longer than total lengths of Mysis captured in vertical plankton tows. Pontoporeia hoyi occurred in alewife stomachs in late afternoon (September) and early evening (June, October). Microcrustacean zooplankton were eaten mostly during day (June) or early morning (October). As Mysis was the most important food, the vertical migration of alewives is interpreted as an adaptation for feeding on vertically migrating Mysis.Key words: alewives, Lake Michigan, Mysis, Pontoporeia hoyi, vertical migration, feeding ecology, light},

Pacific salmon ( Oncorhynchus spp.) strongly impact nutrient dynamics in inland waters and anadromous alewife ( Alosa pseudoharengus ) may play a similar ecological role along the Atlantic coast. The annual spawning migration of anadromous alewife contributes, on average, 1050 g of nitrogen and 120 g of phosphorus to Bride Brook, Connecticut, USA, through excretion and mortality each year. Natural abundance stable isotope analyses indicate that this influx of marine-derived nitrogen is rapidly incorporated into the stream food web. An enriched δ

              N signal, indicative of a marine origin, is present at all stream trophic levels with the greatest level of enrichment coincident with the timing of the anadromous alewife spawning migration. There was no significant effect of this nutrient influx on water chemistry, leaf decomposition, or periphyton accrual. Dam removal and fish ladder construction will allow anadromous alewife to regain access to historical freshwater spawning habitats, potentially impacting food web dynamics and nutrient cycling in coastal freshwater systems.},

              Anguilla rostrata
              , were displaced 10–17 km between tidal fresh water and salinity-stratified water and followed to determine the degree of home site fidelity, swiftness of homing and whether environmental factors affect orientation or homing behaviour. Twenty-one eels were tracked continuously (eight eels displaced up the estuary, eight down the estuary and five controls) in the Penobscot Estuary, Maine, USA for 4–80 h each, while recording position every 20 min. Nine of the 16 displaced eels (56\%) returned to their capture site either during the track or shortly afterwards. Three of the remaining seven eels made substantial progress towards their capture site within the time observed. Eels homed with equal frequency whether displaced up or down the estuary in an average of 220 h ±87 (SE). After release, no eel moved farther away from its capture site. The eels were active mostly at night but used only the appropriate tidal currents rather than directed swimming to move about their home range and to home. Control tracks provided a home-range estimate in this habitat of 6.7 ±1.6 km of estuary or 325 ±64 ha. Lunar phase or position of the moon did not appear to influence either homing behaviour or activity patterns. This study shows that orientation and homing to a specific site in eels occurs relatively quickly and with no initial errors in orientation.},

In the seasonally ice-covered southern Gulf of St Lawrence, Canada, locations of summer fyke and winter spear fisheries indicate that American eels (Anguilla rostrata) are widely distributed in both summer and winter in shallow soft-bottomed bay and estuarine habitat. Captive eels in fresh water preferred mud substrates during summer, during pre-winter cooling and during post-winter warming periods, but in winter chose mud and cobble substrates at approximately equal frequencies. Plasma antifreeze was not detected in blood sampled from eels speared in mud under winter ice. Winter bottom water temperatures in an eel wintering site were below the approximate freezing point of fish tissue 29.9\% of the time. Mud of eel wintering grounds is warmer than overlying water and appears to serve as a thermal sanctuary that allows eels to safely overwinter under ice-covered waters. American eels in the southern Gulf of St Lawrence spend {\textasciitilde}67\% of their annual cycle within the substrate.},

	abstract = {Management of American eels (Anguilla rostrata) requires an understanding of how demographic attributes vary within large estuaries. Yellow-phase American eel length and age structure, growth, dispersal, nematode infestation rates, loss rate (natural mortality and emigration), and production were measured at six sites throughout the tidal portion of the Hudson River. Short-term dispersal was low, with {\textgreater}70\% of eels at all sites captured {\textless}1 km from their original tagging area. Length was similar among sites (total length = 45.7 ± 0.3 cm), whereas age was substantially lower for brackish-water sites (8 ± 4 years) than for freshwater sites (17 ± 4 years). Growth was higher for brackish-water sites than for freshwater sites (8.0 cm·year
              –1
              and 3.4 cm·year
              –1
              , respectively). From 1997 to 2000, infestation by the exotic nematode Anguillicola crassus increased dramatically in mean intensity as well as prevalence. Annual loss rates measured for the six sites varied between 9\% and 24\%, with no statistical difference between freshwater and brackish-water sites. Estimated eel production was higher in a brackish-water habitat (1.10–1.77 kg·ha

	abstract = {Efforts to conserve endangered species usually involve attempts to define and manage threats at the appropriate scale of population processes. In some species that scale is localized; in others, dispersal and migration link demic units within larger metapopulations. Current conservation strategies for endangered shortnose sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum) assume the species is river resident, with little to no movement between rivers. However we have found that shortnose sturgeon travel more than 130 km through coastal waters between the largest rivers in Maine. Indeed, acoustic telemetry shows that shortnose sturgeon enter six out of the seven acoustically monitored rivers we have monitored, with over 70\% of tagged individuals undertaking coastal migrations between river systems. Four migration patterns were identified for shortnose sturgeon inhabiting the Penobscot River, Maine: river resident (28\%), spring coastal emigrant (24\%), fall coastal emigrant (33\%), and summer coastal emigrant (15\%). No shortnose sturgeon classified as maturing female exhibited a resident pattern, indicating differential migration. Traditional river-specific assessment and management of shortnose sturgeon could be better characterized using a broader metapopulation scale, at least in the Gulf of Maine, that accounts for diverse migratory strategies and the importance of migratory corridors as critical habitat.},

Smolt downstream movements were initially low, peaked in mid-May, and subsequently declined under all conditions. Parr downstream movements were significantly lower than those of smolts in all treatments (0.8 ± 0.5 movement·day              1              versus 26.5 ± 4.5 movements·day              1              , mean ± SE) and showed no increase.

Physiological changes associated with smolting (gill Na              +              ,K              +              -ATPase activity and plasma thyroxine) were coincident with behavioral changes.

            Dams are a major contributor to the historic decline and current low abundance of diadromous fish. We developed a population viability analysis to assess demographic effects of dams on diadromous fish within a river system and demonstrated an application of the model with Atlantic salmon in the Penobscot River, Maine. We used abundance and distribution of wild- and hatchery-origin adult salmon throughout the watershed as performance metrics. Salmon abundance, distribution to upper reaches of the Penobscot watershed, and the number and proportion of wild-origin fish in the upper reaches of the Penobscot watershed increased when dams, particularly mainstem dams, were removed or passage efficiency was increased. Salmon abundance decreased as indirect latent mortality per dam was increased. Salmon abundance increased as marine or freshwater survival rates were increased, but the increase in abundance was larger when marine survival was increased than when freshwater survival was increased. Without hatchery supplementation, salmon abundance equalled zero with low marine and freshwater survival but increased when marine and freshwater survival rates were increased. Models, such as this one, that incorporate biological, environmental, and functional parameters can be used to predict ecological responses of fish populations and can help evaluate and prioritize management and restoration actions for diadromous fish.},

            The term river herring collectively refers to alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) and blueback herring (A. aestivalis), two anadromous fishes distributed along the east coast of North America. Historically, river herring spawning migrations supported important fisheries, and their spawning runs continue to be of cultural significance to many coastal communities. Recently, substantial declines in spawning run size prompted a petition to consider river herring for listing under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The ESA status review process requires an evaluation of a species’ response to multiple stressors, including climate change. For anadromous species that utilize a range of habitats throughout their life cycle, the response to a changing global climate is inherently complex and likely varies regionally. River herring occupy marine habitat for most of their lives, and we demonstrate that their relative abundance in the ocean has been increasing in recent years. We project potential effects of ocean warming along the US Atlantic coast on river herring in two seasons (spring and fall), and two future periods (2020–2060 and 2060–2100) by linking species distribution models to projected temperature changes from global climate models. Our analyses indicate that climate change will likely result in reductions in total suitable habitat across the study region, which will alter the marine distribution of river herring. We also project that density will likely decrease for both species in fall, but may increase in spring. Finally, we demonstrate that river herring may have increased sensitivity to climate change under a low abundance scenario. This result could be an important consideration for resource managers when planning for climate change because establishing effective conservation efforts in the near term may improve population resiliency and provide lasting benefits to river herring populations.},

In the 2010s, alewife arrived to spawning habitat 16 days earlier and egressed 27 days earlier (peak 12 days earlier) relative to the 1970s. Blueback herring arrived 5 days earlier and egressed 23 days earlier (peak 13 days earlier) in the 2010s relative to the 1980s. The changes in ingress and egress timing have shortened the occurrence in spawning systems by 11 days for alewife over four decades and 18 days for blueback herring over three decades. We found that the rate of vernal warming was faster during 2001–2016 relative to 1973–1988 and is the most parsimonious explanation for changes in spawning phenology.

Age of larval and juvenile shad was estimated by counting daily rings on sagittal otoliths and age-specific length increments determined by backcalculation techniques. Cohort-specific growth rates of larval shad increased linearly with rising zooplankton densities, and asymptotically with rising river temperatures and declining flows. By contrast, juvenile growth rates among 5-d cohorts showed no significant linear or nonlinear relationships to water temperatures and flows.},

            Habitat suitability index models for American shad Alosa sapidissima were developed by Stier and Crance in 1985. These models, which were based on a combination of published information and expert opinion, are often used to make decisions about hydropower dam operations and fish passage. The purpose of this study was to develop updated habitat suitability index models for spawning American shad in the southeastern United States, building on the many field and laboratory studies completed since 1985. We surveyed biologists who had knowledge about American shad spawning grounds, assembled a panel of experts to discuss important habitat variables, and used raw data from published and unpublished studies to develop new habitat suitability curves. The updated curves are based on resource selection functions, which can model habitat selectivity based on use and availability of particular habitats. Using field data collected in eight rivers from Virginia to Florida (Mattaponi, Pamunkey, Roanoke, Tar, Neuse, Cape Fear, Pee Dee, St. Johns), we obtained new curves for temperature, current velocity, and depth that were generally similar to the original models. Our new suitability function for substrate was also similar to the original pattern, except that sand (optimal in the original model) has a very low estimated suitability. The Bayesian approach that we used to develop habitat suitability curves provides an objective framework for updating the model as new studies are completed and for testing the model's applicability in other parts of the species' range.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
            In close exoplanetary systems, tidal interactions drive orbital and spin evolution of planets and stars over long time-scales. Tidally forced inertial waves (restored by the Coriolis acceleration) in the convective envelopes of low-mass stars and giant gaseous planets contribute greatly to the tidal dissipation when they are excited and subsequently damped (e.g. through viscous friction), especially early in the life of a system. These waves are known to be subject to non-linear effects, including triggering differential rotation in the form of zonal flows. In this study, we use a realistic tidal body forcing to excite inertial waves through the residual action of the equilibrium tide in the momentum equation for the waves. By performing 3D non-linear hydrodynamical simulations in adiabatic and incompressible convective shells, we investigate how the addition of non-linear terms affects the tidal flow properties, and the energy and angular momentum redistribution. In particular, we identify and justify the removal of terms responsible for unphysical angular momentum evolution observed in a previous numerical study. Within our new set-up, we observe the establishment of strong cylindrically sheared zonal flows, which modify the tidal dissipation rates from prior linear theoretical predictions. We demonstrate that the effects of this differential rotation on the waves neatly explains the discrepancies between linear and non-linear dissipation rates in many of our simulations. We also highlight the major role of both corotation resonances and parametric instabilities of inertial waves, which are observed for sufficiently high tidal forcing amplitudes or low viscosities, in affecting the tidal flow response.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in our understanding of estuarine circulation and salinity structure are reviewed. We focus on well- and partially mixed systems that are long relative to the tidal excursion. Dynamics of the coupled system of width- and tidally averaged momentum and salt equations are now better understood owing to the development of simple numerical solution techniques. These have led to a greater appreciation of the key role played by the time dependency of the length of the salt intrusion. Improved realism in simplified tidally averaged physics has been driven by simultaneous advances in our understanding of the detailed dynamics within the tidal cycle and across irregular channel cross-sections. The complex interactions of turbulence, stratification, and advection are now understood well enough to motivate a new generation of physically plausible mixing parameterizations for the tidally averaged equations.},
