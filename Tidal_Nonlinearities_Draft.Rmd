Objective: Investigate the impact of tidal non-linearities on material transport using field observations.
Tasks: 
- Use two Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) deployed near Bangor over 30 days during the dry and wet seasons to quantify barotropic overtides and overtides in current velocities.
- Calibrate measurements of turbidity from acoustic backscatter from the ADCPs to suspended sediment concentrations using water samples.
- Use Wavelet analysis to understand how the M4 oscillations contribute to subtidal flows and material transport during wet and dry seasons.
