We focus on well- and partially mixed systems that are long relative to the tidal excursion. Dynamics of the coupled system of width- and tidally averaged momentum and salt equations are now better understood owing to the development of simple numerical solution techniques. These have led to a greater appreciation of the key role played by the time dependency of the length of the salt intrusion. Improved realism in simplified tidally averaged physics has been driven by simultaneous advances in our understanding of the detailed dynamics within the tidal cycle and across irregular channel cross-sections. The complex interactions of turbulence, stratification, and advection are now understood well enough to motivate a new generation of physically plausible mixing parameterizations for the tidally averaged equations.},

	abstract = {This textbook provides an in-depth overview of the hydrodynamics of estuaries and semi-enclosed bodies of water. It begins by describing the typical classification of estuaries, followed by a presentation of the quantitative tools needed to study these basins: conservation of mass, salt, heat, momentum, and the thermodynamic equation of seawater. Further topics explore tides in homogeneous basins, including shallow water tides and tidal residual flows, wind-driven flows in homogeneous basins, density-driven flows, as well as interactions among tides, winds and density gradients. The book proposes a classification of semi-enclosed basins that is based on dominant dynamics, comparing forcing agents and restorative or balancing forces. Introduction to Estuarine Hydrodynamics provides an introduction for advanced students and researchers across a range of disciplines - Earth science, environmental science, biology, chemistry, geology, hydrology, physics - related to the study of estuarine systems.},

	abstract = {Tidally driven residual circulation in shallow estuaries with lateral depth variation has been studied analytically using a two‐dimensional, depth‐averaged model. The solution is presented for a v‐shaped channel. Exchange flow is found to be correlated with the topography. The magnitude of this exchange flow depends mainly on four parameters: the ratio between the minimum depth on the shoal and the maximum depth in the channel, the ratio between the tidal amplitude at the mouth and the mean depth, the ratio between the length of the estuary and the tidal wave length, and the ratio between the tidal timescale and the decay timescale due to friction. Generally, a net landward flow occurs over the shoals and is balanced by a return flow in the channel. The along‐channel residual velocity changes nearly linearly across the estuary. The residual velocity decreases monotonically toward the head of the estuary. The transverse residual velocity is convergent in the channel and divergent on the shoals. The residual velocity is highly dependent on the length of the estuary. When the length of the estuary is much smaller than a quarter of the wave length, the residual velocity is relatively small. When the length of the estuary is about a quarter of the wave length, the magnitude of the residual velocity reaches its maximum. When the length of the estuary is much larger than a quarter of the wave length, the residual circulation approaches the pattern found in an infinite length estuary. On the basis of the analysis of the solution, we conclude that exchange flow generated by tides in a shallow estuary is the result of competition among several processes. An inward flux is caused by local nonlinearity, both in the bottom friction and from propagation of the tidal wave of finite amplitude. This inward flux is larger on the shoals and smaller in the channel owing to larger nonlinearity in the shallow water. The residual inward flow creates a setup (residual surface elevation) of water at the head of the estuary that produces a pressure gradient. This residual pressure gradient is approximately uniform across the estuary and drives an outward flow that is larger in the channel than on the shoals. In all of the parameter space the competition results in a net inflow on the shoals and a net outflow in the channel.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Subtidal flows driven by density gradients affect the tide‐averaged sediment transport in estuaries and, therefore, can influence their long‐term morphodynamic evolution. The three‐dimensional Coupled Ocean‐Atmosphere‐Wave‐Sediment Transport modeling system is applied to numerically analyze the effects of baroclinicity and Earth's rotation on the long‐term morphodynamic evolution of idealized funnel‐shaped estuaries. The morphodynamic evolution in all the analyzed cases reproduced structures identified in many tide‐dominated estuaries: a meandering region in the fluvial‐tidal transition zone, a tidal maximum area close to the head, and a turbidity maxima region in the brackish zone. As the morphology of the estuaries evolved, the tidal propagation (including its asymmetry), the salinity gradient, and the strength of subtidal flows changed, which reflects the strong bathymetric control of these systems. The comparison with barotropic simulations showed that the three‐dimensional structure of the flow (induced by density gradients) has leading order effects on the morphodynamic evolution. Density gradient‐driven subtidal flows (1) promote near‐bed flood dominance and, consequently, the import of sediment into the estuary, (2) accelerate the morphodynamic evolution of the upper/middle estuary, (3) promote a more concave shape of the upper estuary and reduce the ebb‐tidal delta volume, and (4) produce an asymmetric bathymetry and inhibit the formation of alternate bars that would form under barotropic conditions. This latter effect is the consequence of the combined effect of Earth's rotation and baroclinicity.
