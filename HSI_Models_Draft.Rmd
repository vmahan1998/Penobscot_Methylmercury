# Technical Report: Habitat Suitability Models for Diadromous Fish in the Northeast United States

## Preface

## Abstract

## Introduction

Diadromous fish species exhibit a remarkable migratory behavior between marine and freshwater environments, which plays a pivotal role in the ecological and socio-economic fabric of coastal communities. Their migration enables access to essential resources, identification of suitable spawning grounds, and maintenance of population connectivity, thereby contributing to the overall health and resilience of aquatic ecosystems. These migratory patterns can be classified into two types: anadromy, involving spawning in fresh or brackish inland water, and catadromy, where reproduction occurs at sea (Limburg & Waldman, 2009). The economic and cultural implications of these migratory movements are significant, as diadromous fish provide essential food resources, support recreational fisheries, and hold cultural importance for coastal and indigenous communities. Understanding and conserving these remarkable migratory species are crucial for sustaining livelihoods, traditions, and cultural heritage associated with coastal communities.

In the Northeastern United States, diadromous fish populations have experienced a historic decline over the past century due to factors such as river damming, overfishing, and pollution (Brown et al., 2000).(expand on level of decline). This decline has had profound effects on coastal communities that depend on diadromous fish for their economic and cultural well-being, jeopardizing the availability of vital food resources and impacting the economic stability and cultural heritage of these communities.

Effective fisheries management and conservation efforts necessitate an understanding of the habitat requirements and distribution patterns of diadromous fish species. Studying and monitoring the habitats used by these fish enable the identification of key areas for protection and restoration, implementation of sustainable fishing practices, and mitigation of pollution and habitat alteration. Preserving and restoring these habitats are crucial steps towards ensuring the recovery and resilience of diadromous fish populations, which, in turn, supports the economic viability and cultural identity of coastal communities.

Although existing habitat suitability index (HSI) models have played a significant role in understanding habitat preferences and guiding conservation efforts, it is important to note their limitations. Many of these models, developed based on the best available data and observations at the time, are outdated and often fail to accurately capture the complexity of diadromous fish populations. They frequently group together similar species, such as Atlantic and Shortnose Sturgeon or Alewives and Blueback Herring, due to limited available data, thereby overlooking the distinct ecological requirements and behaviors of these species (Pardue, 1983). Moreover, these models may be based on observations and methods that may not be directly relevant to the specific ecosystems being studied. For example, they may rely on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Habitat Evaluation Procedures Program, which primarily focuses on developing detailed models for assessing relatively small areas in terrestrial or freshwater environments (USFWS 1980a, 1980b, 1981; Able et al., 2020). (highlight specific challenges associated with grouping similar species and the implications of outdated data)

Technological advancements such as acoustic telemetry, remote sensing, eDNA analysis, and high-resolution imaging have facilitated the increase in observations, studies, and data on diadromous fish behavior and movement. This wealth of new information has provided valuable insights into the specific habitat requirements, migration patterns, and population dynamics of individual species within the diadromous fish community. To reflect these advancements more accurately, it is necessary to update and refine the existing HSI models. Index models, which can directly respond to changes in physical properties and establish a clear link to changes in ecosystem quantity and quality resulting from a change in environmental conditions, can be particularly valuable in this regard (_NYBEM Report 2022_). 

Refined models incorporating these index approaches will exhibit direct sensitivity to alterations in physical characteristics, ensuring a more precise representation of habitat suitability for each diadromous fish species. This improved accuracy enhances the assessment of the impact of changing environmental conditions on the distribution and abundance of diadromous fish throughout the Northeast United States, facilitating targeted conservation efforts and effective fisheries management strategies. These updated models can also account for the unique ecological characteristics of each species, enabling more precise assessments of their distribution and the identification of critical areas for juvenile and spawning adults. The objectives of this paper are to synthesize the latest life cycle observations, studies, and data on diadromous fish species in the Northeastern United States and develop updated species-specific habitat suitability index (HSI) models for Atlantic Salmon, Atlantic Sturgeon, Alewives, American Eels, American Shad, Atlantic Tomcod, Blueback Herring, Rainbow Smelt, Shortnose Sturgeon, and Striped Bass, considering their unique habitat preferences and ecological needs during the juvenile and spawning adult life stages. By achieving these objectives, this study aims to contribute to a broader understanding of diadromous fish ecology, support effective fisheries management, and inform conservation strategies for the benefit of both the species and the coastal communities dependent on them.

## Methods

To develop the habitat suitability model for each diadromous fish species, a comprehensive and rigorous scientific process was followed. The first step involved synthesizing current relevant literature to gather a comprehensive understanding of the species' habitat requirements, and previously published habitat models. This involved conducting an extensive review of scientific articles, reports, and studies that documented the ecological characteristics, migratory behaviors, and habitat associations of the 10 diadromous fish species under study. By assimilating this wealth of information, this study aims to ensure that the models capture the most up-to-date knowledge and insights into the specific needs and preferences of each species.

Building upon this literature synthesis, we developed a comprehensive habitat index that incorporated the key environmental variables known to influence the survival, growth, and reproduction of diadromous fish. For diadromous species in the northeast, environmental variables like water temperature, depth, salinity, flow velocity, and substrate type are important for defining estuarine habitat (Brown et al 2000). The calculation used for the models was an unweighted geometric mean. The geometric mean was chosen over an arithmetic mean due to its multiplicative calculation, which ensures that if any term in the model is zero, the overall suitability will also be zero. This approach emphasizes the importance of each environmental variable within the model, effectively identifying unsuitable habitats where any single characteristic falls outside the species' range of preference.

In some cases, certain habitat variables were excluded from the final models based on a comprehensive analysis of the literature and expert judgment. "For example, the distribution of Atlantic tomcod juvenile was found to be independent of substrate type, leading to the exclusion of this variable from the final model." This reduction in variables allowed for a more streamlined and focused model that captured the most influential factors driving habitat suitability for each diadromous fish species.

A systematic approach based on the available literature and previously published models was used to assign suitability index (SI) values to the ranges of each environmental variable. This involved determining the specific ranges of each variable that corresponded to different levels of suitability, ranging from 0 to 1. For instance, the most favorable conditions were assigned an SI of 1.0, representing highly suitable habitat for the species. An SI of 0.5 was assigned to ranges of environmental conditions approximately representing average suitability, indicating habitat about half as suitable as the most favorable conditions. In cases where species or life stages could occur but were rare, an SI of 0.1 was assigned, representing habitat approximately 1/10 as suitable as the most favorable conditions. Finally, an SI of 0 was assigned to environmental parameters outside the naturally used range for the particular species or life stage.

By following this systematic approach, we generated habitat suitability models for each of the 10 diadromous fish species, producing an average suitability index using the unweighted geometric mean. This allowed for a comprehensive evaluation of the habitat suitability across all environmental variables, with equal weighting assigned to each factor. The resulting models provide a quantitative assessment of the species' habitat preferences and allow for the identification of critical areas of interest for survival, reproduction, and migration. The development of these updated habitat suitability models represents a significant improvement over previous approaches, as they incorporate the latest research, knowledge, and understanding of the diadromous fish species' ecology and habitat requirements.


## Alewives

Alewives are widely distributed throughout the northeastern United States, inhabiting coastal areas from the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada to the mid-Atlantic region of the United States (citation needed). They are particularly abundant in freshwater rivers and estuaries along the Atlantic coast. Figure x shows the range of alewife habitat throughout the Northeast. Alewife populations can be found in various states, including Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, and Delaware, among others. They have historically undertaken extensive spawning migrations, ascending rivers and streams from their marine habitat to reach their preferred spawning grounds in freshwater tidal systems (citation needed). The distribution of alewife populations is influenced by several factors, including the availability of suitable spawning habitats, water quality conditions, and the presence of appropriate food resources (citation needed). 

The alewife, exhibits a complex life cycle characterized by distinct stages and behaviors. The spawning of alewives typically occurs in waves during the spring season, triggered by rising water temperatures and increasing day length (Able et al., 2020). Adult alewives migrate upstream from their marine environment to reach suitable spawning habitats. Upon arrival, they engage in impressive spawning runs, where large aggregations of individuals gather at spawning grounds.

During the spawning process, male alewives release sperm into the water, while females deposit their adhesive eggs over gravel or other hard-substrate types. Alewife eggs are fertilized externally, and after spawning, both males and females return to the marine environment. The adhesive nature of the eggs helps them attach to the substrate, protecting them from being washed away by the current (Brown et al., 2000).

Following spawning, the eggs undergo a period of incubation, which typically lasts for several weeks. The exact duration depends on environmental conditions such as water temperature. Once the eggs hatch, the larvae emerge and begin their migration upstream where they will use the estuary habitat as a nursery until migrating out to sea (Pardue, 1983). Alewife larvae exhibit high rates of survival early on in higher concentrations of salinity (diMaggio 2015).
