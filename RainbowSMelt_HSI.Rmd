Flow velocity: Rainbow smelt juveniles prefer habitats with moderate to fast flow velocities (Barton and Hartman 1985; Van den Avyle and Haas 1986). The HSI for flow velocity can be calculated as:
HSI(flow velocity) = (flow velocity - min velocity) / (max velocity - min velocity)

Where min velocity is the minimum flow velocity recorded for rainbow smelt juveniles and max velocity is the maximum flow velocity recorded.

Temperature: Rainbow smelt juveniles prefer habitats with temperatures ranging from 5 to 18Â°C (Johnson and McKenzie 1987; Gorman and Kocik 2005). The HSI for temperature can be calculated as:
HSI(temperature) = (max temperature - |optimum temperature - current temperature|) / (max temperature - min temperature)

Where optimum temperature is the temperature at which rainbow smelt juveniles show the highest growth rate, and min and max temperatures are the minimum and maximum temperatures recorded for rainbow smelt juveniles.

Salinity: Rainbow smelt juveniles prefer habitats with low to moderate salinity levels (Morris et al. 2010; Randall et al. 2012). The HSI for salinity can be calculated as:
HSI(salinity) = (max salinity - |optimum salinity - current salinity|) / (max salinity - min salinity)

Where optimum salinity is the salinity at which rainbow smelt juveniles show the highest survival rate, and min and max salinities are the minimum and maximum salinities recorded for rainbow smelt juveniles.

Depth: Rainbow smelt juveniles prefer habitats with shallow to moderate depths (Lapointe et al. 2011; Murchie and Danilowicz 2017). The HSI for depth can be calculated as:
HSI(depth) = (depth - min depth) / (max depth - min depth)

Where min depth is the minimum depth recorded for rainbow smelt juveniles and max depth is the maximum depth recorded.

Finally, the overall HSI for rainbow smelt juveniles can be calculated as the product of the individual HSI values:

HSI(overall) = HSI(flow velocity) * HSI(temperature) * HSI(salinity) * HSI(depth)
