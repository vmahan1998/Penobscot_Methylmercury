	abstract = {The Penobscot River basin, covering approximately 22,265 km2, is the largest river wholly within Maine and the second largest river system in New England. The Penobscot River Restoration Project (PRRP) is a multimillion-dollar endeavor that aims to restore native sea-run fish through the removal of two main-stem dams and improved fish passage at a third dam on the Penobscot River. We used geographical information systems, accounts of historic ranges, and barrier survey data to estimate species-specific distributions and habitat accessibility for 11 diadromous species before and after the proposed restoration. We predict a range of outcomes in terms of expected distribution and accessibility that are largely based on habitat use and life history differences. For 4 out of 11 species (Atlantic sturgeon Acipenser oxyrinchus, shortnose sturgeon A. brevirostrum, Atlantic tomcod Microgadus tomcod, and striped bass Morone saxatillis), the PRRP is anticipated to provide access to 100\% of their historic freshwater habitat. However, for alewives Alosa pseudoharengus, approximately 69\% of the historic spawning and rearing habitat will remain inaccessible due to the presence of other passage barriers. Our results demonstrate that the PRRP is an important step toward ecosystem recovery in the Penobscot River basin but that other restoration activities will be needed to realize the full potential of the PRRP, particularly for alosines. Further, our results provide the first spatial analysis of diadromous fish distribution and access following the PRRP and serve as the baseline for developing a guiding image for expected diadromous fish population responses following the dam removals.},

	abstract = {Relatively little is known about the distribution and seasonal movement patterns of shortnose sturgeon Acipenser brevirostrum and Atlantic sturgeon Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus occupying rivers in the northern part of their range. During 2006 and 2007, 40 shortnose sturgeon (66–113.4 cm fork length [FL]) and 8 Atlantic sturgeon (76.2–166.2 cm FL) were captured in the Penobscot River, Maine, implanted with acoustic transmitters, and monitored using an array of acoustic receivers in the Penobscot River estuary and Penobscot Bay. Shortnose sturgeon were present year round in the estuary and overwintered from fall (mid-October) to spring (mid-April) in the upper estuary. In early spring, all individuals moved downstream to the middle estuary. Over the course of the summer, many individuals moved upstream to approximately 2 km of the downstream-most dam (46 river kilometers [rkm] from the Penobscot River mouth [rkm 0]) by August. Most aggregated into an overwintering site (rkm 36.5) in mid- to late fall. As many as 50\% of the tagged shortnose sturgeon moved into and out of the Penobscot River system during 2007, and 83\% were subsequently detected by an acoustic array in the Kennebec River, located 150 km from the Penobscot River estuary. Atlantic sturgeon moved into the estuary from the ocean in the summer and concentrated into a 1.5-km reach. All Atlantic sturgeon moved to the ocean by fall, and two of these were detected in the Kennebec River. Although these behaviors are common for Atlantic sturgeon, regular coastal migrations of shortnose sturgeon have not been documented previously in this region. These results have important implications for future dam removals as well as for rangewide and river-specific shortnose sturgeon management.},

	abstract = {The abundance, distribution, and size of marine species are linked to temperature and nutrient regimes and are profoundly affected by humans through exploitation and climate change. Yet little is known about long-term historical links between ocean environmental changes and resource abundance to provide context for current and potential future trends and inform conservation and management. We synthesize {\textgreater}4000 years of climate and marine ecosystem dynamics in a Northwest Atlantic region currently undergoing rapid changes, the Gulf of Maine and Scotian Shelf. This period spans the late Holocene cooling and recent warming and includes both Indigenous and European influence. We compare environmental records from instrumental, sedimentary, coral, and mollusk archives with ecological records from fossils, archaeological, historical, and modern data, and integrate future model projections of environmental and ecosystem changes. This multidisciplinary synthesis provides insight into multiple reference points and shifting baselines of environmental and ecosystem conditions, and projects a near-future departure from natural climate variability in 2028 for the Scotian Shelf and 2034 for the Gulf of Maine. Our work helps advancing integrative end-to-end modeling to improve the predictive capacity of ecosystem forecasts with climate change. Our results can be used to adjust marine conservation strategies and network planning and adapt ecosystem-based management with climate change.},

	abstract = {We evaluated the ability of numerical habitat models (NHM) to predict the distribution of juveniles of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in a river. NHMs comprise a hydrodynamic model (to predict water depth and current speed for any given flow) and a biological model (to predict habitat quality for fish using water depth, current speed, and substrate composition). We implemented NHMs with a biological model based on (i) preference curves defined by the ratio of the use to the availability of physical conditions and (ii) a multivariate logistic regression that distinguished between the physical conditions used and avoided by fish. Preference curves provided a habitat suitability index (HSI) ranging from 0 to 1, and the logistic regression produced a habitat probabilistic index (HPI) representing the probability of observing a parr under given physical conditions. Pearson's correlation coefficients between HSI and local densities of parr ranged from 0.39 to 0.63 depending on flow. Corresponding values for HPI ranged from 0.81 to 0.98. We concluded that HPI may be a more powerful biological model than HSI for predicting local variations in fish density, forecasting fish distribution patterns, and performing summer habitat modelling for Atlantic salmon juveniles.},
